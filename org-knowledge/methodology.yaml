delivery_methodology:
  name: "Acme Agile Delivery Framework (AADF)"
  description: >
    Acme's proprietary Agile Delivery Framework is a SAFe-aligned, hybrid agile methodology
    tailored for federal and regulated-industry engagements. AADF combines the speed and
    adaptability of Scrum with the governance rigor required by FISMA, CMMI Level 3, and
    federal acquisition regulations. All programs operate in 2-week sprints within a
    structured Program Increment (PI) planning cadence of 10 weeks. AADF integrates
    security and compliance activities directly into the sprint workflow, ensuring zero
    end-of-project compliance surprises.

sdlc_approach:
  name: "Secure Iterative SDLC"
  description: >
    Acme's SDLC is security-first and iterative, embedding security controls at every stage
    rather than treating security as a final-phase gate. Our shift-left approach integrates
    static analysis, dependency scanning, container security, and threat modeling into the
    developer workflow. All code is peer-reviewed before merging; no code enters the main
    branch without passing automated quality and security gates.

project_management:
  framework: "PMI/PMBOK 7th Edition aligned with SAFe 6.0"
  tools:
    - "Jira (backlog management, sprint tracking, defect management)"
    - "Confluence (documentation, runbooks, architecture decisions)"
    - "Microsoft Teams (communication and stakeholder collaboration)"
    - "GitHub / GitHub Actions (source control and CI/CD)"
    - "PowerBI (executive dashboards and metrics reporting)"
    - "ServiceNow (ITSM and change management)"
  reporting_cadence: >
    Weekly sprint review reports distributed to client Product Owner and COR. Bi-weekly
    executive dashboard updates to program leadership. Monthly Program Increment reviews
    with full stakeholder community. Quarterly Program Health Reports per contract requirements.
  governance_structure: >
    Each program operates with a Steering Committee (executive sponsors, client COR, Acme VP),
    a Change Control Board meeting bi-weekly, and an Integrated Program Team (IPT) with
    daily operational touchpoints. All change requests are documented, impact-analyzed,
    and approved before implementation.

quality_assurance:
  approach: >
    Shift-left testing with continuous integration, automated quality gates, and mandatory
    peer code review. Every pull request triggers a full suite of automated tests and
    security scans before merge. QA engineers are embedded in squads, not siloed—ensuring
    quality is everyone's responsibility from the first line of code.
  testing_methodology: >
    Multi-layer testing pyramid: unit tests (developer-owned, 80%+ coverage target),
    integration tests (API and service contracts), end-to-end regression tests (critical
    user journeys), performance tests (load, stress, soak), and security tests (SAST,
    DAST, SCA, manual pen test). UAT conducted with real end users in a production-mirror
    environment.
  code_review_process: >
    All pull requests require at least one peer review from a team member and one review
    from a senior or staff engineer before merge. Reviewers evaluate correctness, security,
    performance, readability, and test coverage. Draft PRs are encouraged early to surface
    design issues. Review SLA is 24 hours for standard PRs, 4 hours for hotfixes.
  defect_management: >
    All defects tracked in Jira with severity and priority classification. Critical defects
    (P1) are remediated within 4 hours; High (P2) within 24 hours; Medium (P3) within the
    current sprint; Low (P4) by end of next sprint. Defect trends reviewed weekly by
    the QA Lead and reported to the client COR monthly.

risk_management:
  approach: >
    Proactive, continuous risk identification using a program-wide Risk Register maintained
    in Confluence. Risks are assessed at sprint planning and formally reviewed in monthly
    Risk Board meetings with client stakeholders. Acme uses a probability × impact scoring
    matrix and requires documented mitigation and contingency plans for all Medium+ risks.
  risk_categories:
    - "Technical (architecture, integration, performance)"
    - "Schedule (dependency, resource availability, scope creep)"
    - "Resource (key personnel turnover, skill gaps)"
    - "External (regulatory changes, third-party vendor delays)"
    - "Security (threat landscape, compliance posture)"
    - "Organizational (stakeholder alignment, change management)"
  mitigation_strategies:
    - "Prototyping and architectural spikes for technical unknowns"
    - "20% sprint velocity buffer for unplanned work"
    - "Cross-training and documented knowledge transfer to prevent key-person risk"
    - "30-day incumbent overlap during transition-in"
    - "Continuous monitoring dashboards for security risks"
    - "Executive sponsor alignment sessions for organizational risks"

transition_approach:
  incoming: >
    Acme's 30-day transition-in plan runs concurrently with the incumbent for the first
    month. During this period, we conduct knowledge transfer sessions, document undocumented
    institutional knowledge, inventory all systems and data assets, and onboard cleared
    personnel. We guarantee no degradation of service levels during transition-in and
    deliver a Transition-In Completion Report signed by the client COR.
  outgoing: >
    Acme is committed to seamless transitions. Upon contract end or recompete, we provide
    a minimum 60-day transition-out plan, deliver comprehensive O&M documentation, facilitate
    knowledge transfer sessions with the incoming contractor, and maintain service continuity
    through the last day of performance. All intellectual property developed under the
    contract is delivered to the client in agreed formats.
  knowledge_transfer: >
    Acme's knowledge transfer methodology is documentation-first: we maintain living
    runbooks, architecture decision records (ADRs), and process documentation throughout
    the contract. Transfer sessions are recorded and captioned. We deliver a Transition
    Knowledge Base in the client's preferred system (Confluence, SharePoint, etc.) containing
    all system documentation, SOPs, and institutional knowledge artifacts.
