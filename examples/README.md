# Examples

Sample RFP inputs and generated proposal outputs to help you understand what RFP2Proposal produces.

## Structure

```
examples/
  input/       # Sample RFP documents (PDF, DOCX)
  output/      # Generated proposals and traceability matrices
```

## How to use

1. Drop any file from `input/` into your Claude conversation
2. Run `/generate-proposal`
3. Compare the output to the samples in `output/`

> **Note:** These are sanitized examples. Real RFPs with sensitive client data should never be committed — use the `input/` folder at the repo root (git-ignored) for those.
