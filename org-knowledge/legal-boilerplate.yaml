terms_and_conditions:
  standard_terms: >
    These terms govern the delivery of services by Acme Technology Solutions, Inc. ("Acme")
    under any Statement of Work (SOW) or Task Order referencing these Standard Terms and
    Conditions. In the event of conflict between these terms and a signed SOW, the SOW shall
    control. All work performed is subject to applicable federal acquisition regulations (FAR)
    and agency-specific supplements (e.g., DFARS, HHSAR) where Acme is performing as a
    prime contractor on a U.S. Government contract.

  limitation_of_liability: >
    IN NO EVENT SHALL ACME TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS, INC. BE LIABLE TO THE CLIENT FOR ANY
    INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR
    RELATED TO THE SERVICES, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY. ACME'S TOTAL AGGREGATE
    LIABILITY FOR DIRECT DAMAGES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL FEES PAID BY CLIENT TO ACME
    IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. The foregoing limitations do not apply
    to damages arising from Acme's gross negligence or willful misconduct, or to Acme's
    indemnification obligations under these terms.

  indemnification: >
    Each party shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party and its officers,
    directors, employees, and agents from and against any third-party claims, losses,
    damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from:
    (a) the indemnifying party's breach of these terms; (b) the indemnifying party's gross
    negligence or willful misconduct; or (c) the indemnifying party's infringement of any
    third-party intellectual property right. Acme shall indemnify Client against claims
    that Acme's proprietary tools or methodologies, as delivered to Client, infringe a
    third-party patent, copyright, or trademark, provided Client promptly notifies Acme
    of the claim and cooperates in the defense.

  intellectual_property: >
    All work product, deliverables, software, documentation, and other materials developed
    by Acme specifically for the Client under an applicable SOW ("Work Product") shall be
    considered work made for hire and shall be owned by the Client upon receipt of full
    payment. Acme retains ownership of its pre-existing intellectual property, including
    proprietary tools, frameworks, methodologies, and reusable code libraries ("Acme IP").
    Acme grants Client a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use any Acme IP
    embedded in delivered Work Product solely for Client's internal business purposes.
    For U.S. Government contracts, data rights are governed by FAR 52.227-14 and applicable
    agency supplements; Acme asserts Limited Rights only in proprietary Acme IP not
    specifically funded by the Government.

  data_rights: >
    Client retains full ownership of all Client data processed, stored, or transmitted by
    Acme in the performance of services. Acme shall not use Client data for any purpose
    other than delivering the contracted services. Acme shall implement and maintain
    appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to protect Client data against
    unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction. Upon contract expiration or termination,
    Acme shall return or destroy all Client data within 30 days, as directed by Client in
    writing, and provide written certification of destruction upon request.

  termination_clause: >
    Termination for Convenience: Client may terminate any SOW for convenience upon 30
    days written notice. Upon such termination, Client shall pay Acme for all work
    satisfactorily completed through the termination date, plus reasonable costs incurred
    in connection with termination (including demobilization costs), not to exceed 15% of
    the remaining contract value. Termination for Cause: Either party may terminate a SOW
    for material breach if the breaching party fails to cure such breach within 15 business
    days of written notice specifying the breach in reasonable detail. For government
    contracts, terminations are governed by FAR Part 49.

  dispute_resolution: >
    The parties shall use good-faith efforts to resolve any dispute through direct
    negotiation within 15 business days of written notice of the dispute. If unresolved,
    the parties shall submit the dispute to non-binding mediation before JAMS under its
    Streamlined Mediation Rules. If mediation fails, disputes shall be resolved by binding
    arbitration before JAMS in Washington, D.C. under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules,
    with a single arbitrator. The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable
    attorneys' fees. For disputes arising under U.S. Government contracts, the Contracts
    Disputes Act (41 U.S.C. §§ 7101–7109) shall govern.
